# LFBA_Tokyo

This repository is dedicated to research conducted at the University of Tokyo, where we implement and evaluate LFBA (Logic-Free Building Automation) in practice.
Unlike conventional building automation systems, LFBA directly outputs control signals from the model without predefined logic.
For this study, we developed a system that operates four lights based on predefined scenarios.
